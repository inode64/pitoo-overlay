I was forced to make some changes to the hosting infrastructure.
Due to the nature of eselect-pitoo and make.conf, you need
to do some steps manually to use the new adresses.
Please note, that there might be additional changes in
the near future.

Please do the following to recieve updated packages and snapshots 
from the new server:

1. pull overlay from git if not allready done
2. emerge -u eselect-pitoo
3. emerge -u pitoo-base
4. etc-update or dispatch-conf to merge new make.conf etc...
5. eselect pitoo fetch

now you should be set to carry on as ususal...
